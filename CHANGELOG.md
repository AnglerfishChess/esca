# Changelog

## Unreleased

Nothing released yet. What is in the tree:

- `esca`: `Position`, `Game` and the `Variant` trait, with `Classic` and
  `Chess960` behind it; FEN and EPD, X-FEN and Shredder-FEN castling, legal
  move generation, UCI and SAN move text, and every terminal and claimable
  outcome.
- `Facts`, the v0 schema: nine groups of side-relative position facts plus
  per-move facts, a `schema_id` pinned by golden fixtures, and batch encoders
  that write 1065-wide `f32` rows.
- The `esca` Python package: an abi3-py312 wheel built from the crate, typed,
  with NumPy batch encoding.
- The `lichess` reader: streams the Lichess evaluation dump into encoded
  batches with their targets.
- `anglerfish-core`: the `anglerfish` UCI binary — protocol loop, bounded
  search, move-picking strategies, and the `Evaluator`/`Policy` traits a net
  will plug into (`Uniform` and `Material` until then).
